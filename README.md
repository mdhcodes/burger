# Burger App
Node, Express, and Handlebars

# Overview
Burger App is a burger logger utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Following the MVC design pattern, Node and MySQL query will route data while Handlebars generates HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a 'Devour It' button.

When the user clicks the 'Devour It' button, the burger will move to the right side of the page and a delete 'X' button will appear. If the user chooses to click the delete button, that burger will be removed from the database.

Enjoy!
